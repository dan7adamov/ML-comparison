# Machine learning comparison - project comparing different machine learning algorithms.

Algorithms to compare:
1. NN
2. KNN for K = (3 , 5 , 7, 15)
3. SVM
4. Decision Trees
5. Neural Networks (possibly)

Datasets:
I will be using two datasets of handwritten digits. USPS which needs to be installed from {INSERT HTTP LINK HERE} and MNIST dataset from {INSERT HTTP LINK HERE}.

This project is entirely written in Python3. It should contain the following files with algorithms in separate functions: 
1. nnalgo.py
2. knnalgo.py
3. svm.py
4. dectree.py
5. nn.py
