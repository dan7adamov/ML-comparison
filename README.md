# Machine learning comparison - project comparing different machine learning algorithms.

Algorithms to compare:
1. KNN for K = (1 ... 10)
2. SVM
3. Decision Trees
4. Neural Networks (possibly)

Datasets:
I will be using two datasets of handwritten digits. USPS which needs to be installed from {INSERT HTTP LINK HERE} and MNIST dataset from {INSERT HTTP LINK HERE}. And a more simple control dataset Iris {INSERT HTTP LINK HERE}

This project is entirely written in Python3. It should contain the following files with algorithms in separate functions: 
1. nnalgo.py
2. knnalgo.py
3. svm.py
4. dectree.py
5. nn.py
